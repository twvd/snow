![Snowy Macintosh](images/snowmac.png)

Thank you for checking out Snow! Snow is a classic Macintosh emulator,
emulating Motorola 68k-based Macintosh models. It aims to be user-friendly
as well as an accurate emulation of the original hardware.

Providing an accurate emulation means that Snow does not hook into the
ROM or software running on the Macintosh but instead emulates all the
underlying hardware. This allows Snow to, for example, run applications
off original floppy images with the copy protection intact.

It currently emulates the following Macintosh models:
 * Macintosh 128K, 512K and 512Ke
 * Macintosh Plus
 * Macintosh SE (non-FDHD and FDHD)
 * Macintosh Classic
 * Macintosh II (non-FDHD and FDHD)
 * Macintosh IIx, IIcx, SE/30
