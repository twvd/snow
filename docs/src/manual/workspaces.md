# Workspaces

The Snow user interface has a 'workspace' concept. You can load and save
workspaces from the 'Workspace' menu.

The following things are saved into a workspace file and restored when you
load it:

 * The emulated machine type and selected ROMs
 * Attached SCSI devices and disks (note that removal media is not persisted)
 * The open windows, their position and size
 * The configured display scale and whether the viewport is vertically centered

Paths in the workspace files are relative to the workspace file itself. Keep
that in mind when you move or copy files around.
