# Starting a system

## Obtaining ROM files
In order to emulate a Macintosh, you need a ROM file for the model you want
to emulate. You can obtain these from an original system you own or through
other means. I cannot help you to obtain ROMs.

## Loading a ROM file

To load a ROM file, go to 'Machine > Load ROM' in the menu or click the
<span class="material-symbols-rounded">memory</span> icon in the toolbar.

![Load ROM dialog](../images/load_rom.png)

In the dialog that comes up, select the Macintosh model you want to emulate
and browse for the system ROM.

To emulate the Macintosh II, you also need the ROM of the Macintosh Display
Card 8-24. This ROM is usually labeled 341-0868.bin.

Snow will validate whether your ROM file is correct for the selected model
and the integrity of the file.

<span class="material-symbols-rounded">check_circle</span> indicates the
correct file was selected.

<span class="material-symbols-rounded">error</span> indicates the selected
file is not correct. An error message will tell you what's wrong.

Once everything is good, you can click 'Load and run' to proceed.
